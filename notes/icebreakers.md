* Ask, “Your house is on fire, and everyone is safe. You have 30 seconds to run through the house and collect three or four articles you want to save. What would you grab? Why?”
* What is the most memorable activity you didwith your family as a child?
* What is one characteristic you received from you parents that you want to keep, and one you wish you could change?
* What is a good thing happening in your life right now?
* What do you do for fun?
* Have each person make three statements about themselves: two true statements and one lie. For example, “I’ve never broken a bone. I have 5 sisters. I was born in Yugoslavia.” The group tries to guess which statement is the lie.
* Have each person share their best and worst moments from the previous week. Try to steer the group away from school items. This icebreaker is an easy one to use at first and gives you good feedback concerning their life at the moment. Some veteran groups do this several times a year... the answers become more honest as you go.
