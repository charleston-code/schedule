## HTML, CSS, and JS the hard way

Today, we are going to re-enforce some html, css, and javascript concepts the hard way. By programmatically writing documentation.

We will introduce two new features:

- document.createElement
- appendChild

### Setup

* Create a new folder called `guide`
* Create a new file called `app.js`
* In the terminal `npm install browserify -g`
* In the terminal `npm install wzrd -g`

### Getting Started

* In the terminal `wzrd app.js -p 3000`
Open `app.js`
