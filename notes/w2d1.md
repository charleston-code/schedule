Test Data Set

Using Mock Data to test

Lets build our own utility

* filter
* map
* reduce
* times
* head
* tail
* prop

* pluck = (map + prop)



 filter, map, reduce

Then we want to setup a game loop, the game loop will tick while there are no more cells alive.

This game loop will have a processing function, this function will iterate through all the rows and columns of each row and look at each cell. It will determine if a cell has any neighbors that are alive. Then apply the 4 rules:

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by over-population.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

In an imperative style you will see nested for loops:

for (var row = 0; row < rows.length; row++) {
  for (var col = 0; col < rows[row].length; col++) {
    var neighbors = getNeighbors(row, col)
    if (neighbors < 2 ) {
       set(row,col, 0)
    } else if (neighbors > 3) {
       set(row, col, 0)
    }
  }
}
```
